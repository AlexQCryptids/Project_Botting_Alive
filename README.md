yea congratulation! you found a video game, so go play it

### TLDR

You woke up in a coffin, and all you have is a broken apple watch, with which you can only call some voice bots. Could you use it to get out of here?

### Description

Callie had a long nightmare last night. It began with a tense dinner with her family, following an ugly argument with her girlfriend Beth. She wanted to go back to her dorm, only to forget the room key…

That’s the last thing she remembered.

Then things got even worse. She quickly realized she was buried alive in a coffin. Sure Callie got a broken apple watch, but what could she do with that huh? As she dug deeper into the watch, something strange began to unfold, and the events of yesterday no longer seemed so clear. Details slipped. Doubts crept in. Was any of it real? And wait, is this description even how it really happened?
